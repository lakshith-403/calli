# Vibe coding test: Calli

## Overview

This is a simple app that allows you to manage your finances between friends after a trip.

What i wanted to test was "vibe coding".
According Andrej karpathy it's just vibing with gen ai to make apps.
Sure the code seems messy but it's a weekend project and i'm not gonna maintain it.
Experience is very positive.

I'll probably write a blog on this.
